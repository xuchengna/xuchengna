### EDUCATION
- I am currently a PhD candidate in [College of Civil Engineering and Architecture](http://www.ccea.zju.edu.cn/cceaenglish/main.psp) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).
- Supervised by [Prof. Yu Shao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/shaoyuzju#0), my current research interests include:
  - **Parameter estimation, leakage control for water distribution systems (WDSs);**
  - **Real-time hydraulic modeling;**
  - **WDS optimization analysis;**
  - **Sensor data analysis;**
- Priori to joining ZJU, I received my B.Eng. degree in School of Water Conservancy and Transportation at Zhengzhou University in 2020.
